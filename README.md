# UniversityNow
This repository contains the Stata programs I wrote as part of my analysis of the University Now program. The files have been 
modified to be clean of any sensitive data, so note, some parts of the programs may be missing syntax. This program is not 
meant to be ran, rather it is post here to demonstrate some of my analysis scripts I have written in Stata. 

I have also included some Visual Basic for Applications modules that I used during this analysis to assist me in some analysis 
work I conducted in Excel.
